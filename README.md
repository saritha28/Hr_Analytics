# HR Analytics

## Overview
This HR Analytics project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition within an organization. By leveraging machine learning techniques, it aims to understand the factors influencing employee turnover and build predictive models to forecast attrition rates.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, performance, and whether they left the company or stayed. It serves as the foundation for understanding attrition patterns.

## Data Preprocessing
- Data is cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical data is scaled or normalized for modeling purposes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extensive exploration and visualization of various factors influencing employee attrition, including employee satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, etc.
- Univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns and correlations.

## Feature Engineering
- New features are created or existing ones transformed to enhance model performance.
- Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most influential factors contributing to attrition.

## Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms are employed for prediction:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decison Tree
- Gaussian Navie Bayes
- Linear SVM

Each model is trained to predict employee attrition based on selected features.

## Model Evaluation
- Models are evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, MSE,MAE,RMSE.
- Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

## Usage
- Use the models to predict and understand potential employee attrition factors.
- Experiment with different models, hyperparameters, or feature selections to improve predictive accuracy.
- Employ the insights derived from EDA for strategic HR planning and retention efforts.
